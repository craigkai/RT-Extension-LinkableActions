CONFIGURATION
    This extension uses a custom method call from templates to generate a
    link that will perform a action on click. This method needs to be
    provided with the $Ticket and $Transaction objects from the template.
    You then pass a string of the code you want executed. The example
    template below has a linked action that will resolve the ticket:

        Subject: {$Ticket->Subject}
        Content-Type: text/html

        {
            my $sub = q {
                my ($ret, $msg) = $Ticket->SetStatus('resolved');
                RT::Logger->error($msg) unless $ret;
            };
            $OUT = RT::Extension::LinkableActions->NewLinkAction(
                Ticket        => $Ticket,
                Transaction   => $Transaction,
                Sub           => $sub,
                Name          => 'Issue is resolved',
                NoAuth        => 0
            );
        }

    Where the "Name" key will be the name displayed as the text content of
    the resulting anchor tag.

    **WARNING** Adding the `NoAuth` flag means that anyone can execute
    action as the RT->SystemUser.

  Todo
    * Clean-up template method call

    * Add a `CompileCheck` call on template update to check if code is valid
    in $sub.
